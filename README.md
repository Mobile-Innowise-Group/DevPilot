# DevPilot
#### _Command-line interface (CLI) for generating a Flutter project_


It prompts the user for input and then creates a Flutter project with the given specifications. The generated project will include a set of predefined modules, such as
- Core
- CoreUi
- Data
- Domain
- Navigation

The user can also specify additional
- Features
- Flavors
- Packages

The code uses the [dcli](https://pub.dev/packages/dcli) and [mason_logger](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_logger) packages for input/output handling and logging, respectively. It also relies on several custom classes (**AppConstants**, **DirectoryService**, **FileService**, **Input**, **ScriptService**, and **Validator**) for various tasks.

## Getting Started

Activate globally via:
```sh
dart pub global activate dev_pilot
```

To create project

```sh
dev_pilot create
```
Pub installs executables into $HOME/.pub-cache/bin
If the one not in your path please add this command to your shell's config file (.bashrc, .bash_profile, etc.)

```sh
export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
```
